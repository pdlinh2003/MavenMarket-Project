This is data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the data, building a relational model, adding calculated fields, and designing an interactive report.

I've attached all of the files including:

   - MavenMarketData.zip (zipped folder containing the CSV files I used to build your report)

   - Maven_Market.sql 

   - MavenMarketReport.pbix (dashboard I created)
